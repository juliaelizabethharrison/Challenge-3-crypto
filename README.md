# Challenge-3-crypto

I learned how to collect, prepare and analyze the data from CSV files for both bitsamp and coinbase. I dropped the null values and replaced the dollar signs to type float, and dropped the duplications. I extracted the closing costs, generated the summary statistics, created an overlay of all the prices, and then looked at specific months - early, middle and late. I then analyzed specific dates, Jan 15, Feb 15 and March 15 for comparison of difference of prices from one exchange to another, then generated the plot for the arbitrage spread. The aribtrage spread showed am increase in profitiability at the beginning of the spread and end of the spread. Looked at instances where the spread was positive and profitable, only keeping those trades that returned 1% or higher and generated summary statistics for profitiable trades. Then looked at summary statistics and plotted them through sum and looked at how profits grew during the day.
